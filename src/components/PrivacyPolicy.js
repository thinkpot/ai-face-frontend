                        We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on their servers. The data is 
                        encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase 
                        transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, 
                        your purchase transaction information is not saved.

                    <p className="mt-4">
                        Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which

                        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors,

                        then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
